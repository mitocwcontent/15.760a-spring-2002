{{< anchor "writtenassignments" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Written Assignments
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In preparing the three written case analyses, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1.  Work individually or in groups of two or three students. No groups of four will be permitted. We discourage individual work on the written assignments as we have found that groups develop significantly better solutions.
2.  Hand in one copy of the case write-up for each group.
3.  Written assignments are to be turned in the classroom on the day they are due.
4.  Please keep a copy of your write-up for your own use during class discussion.
5.  Written assignments must be less than 1500 words in length, accompanied by up to 6 supporting exhibits. This is a firm constraint.
6.  Exhibits should contain specific types of analysis, such as financial analysis, break-even charts, cost analysis, process-flow analysis, etc. Exhibits should contain any relevant supporting information that is too detailed for the body of the paper. Exhibits must not be simply an extension of the text. We will not distribute written solutions to the write-ups, but rather will rely on the class session associated with the case to bring out the most important issues.

The case write-ups will be graded using the following criteria (a version of these criteria will accompany your graded assignments):

**Analysis**

1.  Does the paper contain analysis of the major issues?
2.  Does the analysis incorporate properly the relevant tools?
3.  Are assumptions made in the analysis stated explicitly?
4.  Does the analysis isolate the fundamental causes of problems in the case?

**Recommended Actions**

1.  Are the criteria for choosing among alternative recommendations stated?
2.  Are the criteria appropriate?
3.  Is the plan of action integrated in a logical way and linked to the analysis?
4.  Is the action plan specific, complete and practical?
5.  Is it likely that the recommendations will achieve their intended results?

**Exhibits**

1.  Are the analyses in the exhibits done correctly?
2.  Do the exhibits support and add to the text on key points?

**Presentation**

1.  Is the paper too long?
2.  Is the presentation of professional quality?
3.  Is the paper logically consistent and effectively structured to sell its recommendations?
